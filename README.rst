This directory contains the fonts and SVG source files for the logo used 
in the core astropy repository.

The logo uses the Source Sans Pro font, which is an open source font 
created by Adobe. In order to edit the source files for the logo, you 
will need to ensure that this font is installed. For convenience, the 
font files are included in this repository in the ``Source_Sans_Pro`` 
directory.
